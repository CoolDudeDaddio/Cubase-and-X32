The main feature is to put Cubase into record when the MAIN MUTE on a Behringer X32 is actvated.
This stops acoustic feedback when using live mics in the same room as the monitor speakers.
Unmuting the mixer drops Cubase out of record

2 othe items allow you to UNARM all cubase tracks, MONITOR and RECORD modes by pushing a button each on the X32

UPDATE 29 July 2024 PM
I made a better surface to represent part of the X32 and changed some values to get better operation. 
Now the 2 MUTE GROUP buttons UNARM MONITOR and RECORD no matter what state they are in (ie Lit up or dark)
